## Overview

`fastmerkle` is fast tooling for generating Merkle trees, as well as generating and verifying Merkle proofs. Currently,
the supported hashing strategy is _Keccak256_. The tree generation handles uneven data sets by duplicating the last
element on the tree level.

## Quick Start üìù

The overall API footprint of the package is relatively small.

### Package Install

To install the `fastmerkle` package, run:

```bash
go get github.com/Trapesys/fastmerkle
````

### Generate Merkle Tree

```go
// Arbitrary random data used to construct the tree
var randomData [][]byte
randomData = ...

// Generate the Merkle tree
merkleTree, createErr := GenerateMerkleTree(randomData)
if createErr != nil {
// Error occurred during Merkle tree generation
...
}

// Get the Merkle root hash
var merkleRootHash []byte
merkleRootHash = merkleTree.GetRootHash()
```
